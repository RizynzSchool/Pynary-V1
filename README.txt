Pynary V1: The best language!

Overview:

Switching Directories: To switch to a different directory you need to type "chdir" where the file name would originally go. Then type in your full directory to a folder, not a file.

Switching File Extension: To switch the file extension the compiler should look for, you need to type "cdext" where the file name would originally go. Then type in your file extension you want to look for. (THE FILE EXTENSION SHOULD BE ORIGINAL [EX: .pb, .pn, .bx])
